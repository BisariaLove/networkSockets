Introduction
=============
+ POSIX - Portable Operating System Interface.

+ Tcpdump - Communicates directly with the datalink using either the BSD packet filter(BPF) or the datalink provider interface(DLPI)

+ IPv4 provides packet delivery service for TCP, UDP, SCTP, ICMP and IGMP.
+ IPv4(IP) uses 32-bit addressing.
+ Transmission Control Protocol : TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides a reliable, full-duplex byte stream to its users. TCP sockets are an example of stream sockets. TCP takes care of details such as acknowledgments, timeouts, retransmissions, and the like. Most Internet application programs use TCP. Notice that TCP can use either IPv4 or IPv6.
+ User Datagram Protocol:  UDP is a connectionless protocol, and UDP sockets are an example of datagram sockets. There is no guarantee that UDP datagrams ever reach their intended destination. As with TCP, UDP can use either IPv4 or IPv6.

+ Internet Control Message Protocol:  ICMP handles error and control information between routers and hosts. These messages are normally generated by and processed by the TCP/IP networking software itself, not user processes, although we show the ping and traceroute programs, which use ICMP. We sometimes refer to this protocol as ICMPv4 to distinguish it from ICMPv6.
+ Address Resolution Protocol: ARP maps an IPv4 address into a hardware address (such as an Ethernet address). ARP is normally used on broadcast networks such as Ethernet, token ring, and FDDI, and is not needed on point-to-point networks.
+ Reverse Address Resolution Protocol:  RARP maps a hardware address into an IPv4 address. It is sometimes used when a diskless node is booting.
+ BSD packet filter(BPF): This interface provides access to the datalink layer. It is normally found on Berkeley-derived kernels.
+ Datalink provider interface(DLPI): This interface also provides access to the datalink layer. It is normally provided with SVR4.
