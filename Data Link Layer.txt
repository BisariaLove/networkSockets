Data Link Layer
################

+ DLL(Layer 2) is a link-to-link basis protocol and not end-to-end basis protocol.
+ DLL is implemented in each node.
+ LL is implemented in NIC(Network Interface Card).
+ DLL Services
	++ Framing
	++ Error Detection
	++ Flow Control
		+++ Stop and Wait
		+++ Sliding Window protocol
+ Error Control
	++ Receiver simply drops the packet
	++ ARQ(Automatic Repeat Request) protocols
	++ Error Correction(seldom used)
		+++ Receiver is not only able to detect the error, but also locate it and correct it.
+ Point to Point DLC protocols
	++ One Sender, One Receiver, One link
	++ PPP (Point to Point Protocol)
	++ HDLC (High Level Data Link Control)
+ PPP Protocol
	++ Packet Framing is performed.
	++ Only error defection is performed (no correction or recovery).
	++ Corrupted frames silently dropped.
	++ No Flow Control.
	++ Error recovery, flow control, and data-reordering are relegated to higher layers!
	++ Data Frame:
	__________________________________________________
	| flag | address | control | info | check | flag | 
	---------------------------------------------------

	++ address is 11111111 (as it is poin to point).
	++ check - to detect errors in the frame.
+ Framing
	++ Fixed Size Framing - no need to define the boundaries.
	++ Variable Sized Framing - bit- oriented or byte-oriented.
		+++ Byte-stuffing

+ Protocols
	++ For Noiseless Channel
		+++ Simplest
		+++ Stop-and-Wait
	++ For Noisy Channel
		+++ Stop-And-Wait ARQ
		+++ Go-Back-N ARQ
		+++ Selective Repeat ARQ
+ Stop-And-Wait
	++ One frame sent
	++ Acknowledgement received
	++ Then the next frame sent
	++ Only two sequence number 0 and 1.
+ Stop-and-Wait ARQ
	++ Copy of the frame is kept and the retransmission is done when the timer expires or when the acknowledgement gets damaged.
+ Go-Back-N ARQ
	++ Uses Sliding Window protocol.
	++ More that one rame can be outstanding.
	++ Sequence numbers are 2^m(0, 2^m-1).
	++ Sending window is of size 2^m; Receiving window is of size 1.
	++ The receiver sends an ACK if a frame has arrived with no errors detected. If a frame is damaged or received out of order, the receiver is silent and will discard all subsequent frames until it receives the frmae it is exoecting.
	++ The silence of the receiver causes the timer to time out and thus all the other frames are resent.
	++ Cumulative ACK's are supported.
+ Selective Repeat ARQ
	++ Out-of-order frames are buffered y the receiver. Receiver only acknowlwdges the frames that are in order.
	++ the process at the receiver is therefere more complex.
+ Piggybacking
	++ Piggybacking is sending data with the NAK and ACK messages.
	++ It is used in the bidirectional cases, when both the nodes are sending and receiving.
+ Medium Access Control(MAC) Protocols:
	++ Mainly used in case of Multi-point connection.
	++  Data Link Layer can be sub divided into.

		-----------------------------------
	++ Example of multi-point connection are Ethernet(LAN) and cable-access. If two or more nodes transmit simultaneously collisions occurs.
+ IEEE 802 Project
	++ Data Link Layer has been divided into
		+++ Logical Link Control
		+++ Media Access Control
	++ Previously data link control tasks(framing, error detection and control and flow control) are collected into sublayer LLC.
	++ MAC layer provides different protocols for different LANs.
	++ LLC hides the details of the MAC protocols from Network Layer.
	++ CSMA/CD as a MAC method for Ethernet and Token ring passing method for Token Ring LANs.
